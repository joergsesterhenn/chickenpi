4-Channel Relay Module Case by thehair on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:957292

Summary:
This is a case for a SainSmart 4-channel relay module that I have wired to my raspberry pi and controlled through Octoprint.   I designed the case with the following features in mind:  Small form factor  Access holes for JD-VCC pins as well as the line-in pins  Access holes for the screw terminal  Tube/holes for easy viewing of the status LED's  The style of the case was based upon this Raspberry Pi case (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:922740).
